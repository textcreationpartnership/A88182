         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That an Agreement between tho≈øe that tru≈øt, and tho≈øe who are tru≈øted, hath appeared a thing acceptable to this honorable Hou≈øe,
<pb facs="tcp:116135:2"/>
his Excellency, and the Officers of the Army, is as much to our rejoycing, as we conceive it ju≈øt in it ≈øelf, and profitable for the Common-wealth, and cannot doubt but that you will protect tho≈øe of the people, who have no waies forfeited their Birth-right, in their proper liberty of taking this, or any other, as God and their own Con≈øiderationss ≈øhall direct them.</p>
            <p>Which we the rather mention, for that many particulars in the Agreement before you, are upon ≈øerious examination thereof, di≈ø-≈øatisfactory to mo≈øt of tho≈øe who are very earne≈øtly de≈øirous of an Agreement, and many very material things ≈øeem to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theren, which may be ≈øupplyed in another; As</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are now much troubled there ≈øhould be any Intervalls between he ending of this Repre≈øentative, and the begining of the next as being de≈øirous that this pre≈øent Parliament that hath ately done ≈øo great things in ≈øo ≈øhort a time, tending to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, ≈øhould ≈øit; until with certainty and ≈øafety they can ≈øee them deivered into the hands of another Repre≈øentative, rather than to eave them (though never ≈øo ≈ømall a time) under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a Councel of State; a Con≈øtitution of a new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Nature, and which they fear, as the ca≈øe now ≈øtands, may de≈øign to perpetuate their power, and to keep off Parliaments for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They now conceive no le≈øs danger, in that it is provided that Parliaments for the future are to continue but 6. moneths, and a Councel of State 18. In which time, if they ≈øhould prove cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, having command of all Forces by Sea and Land, they will have great opportunities to make them≈øelves ab≈øolute and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable: And becau≈øe this is a danger, than which there cannot well be a greater; they generally incline to Annual Parliaments, bounded and limited as rea≈øon ≈øhall devi≈øe, not di≈ø≈øolvable, but to be continued or adjourned as ≈øhall ≈øeem good in their di≈øcretion, during that yeer, but no longer; and then to di≈ø≈øolve of cour≈øe, and give way to tho≈øe who ≈øhall be cho≈øen immediatly to ≈øucceed them, and in the Intervals of their adjournments, to entru≈øt an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Committee of their own members, as in other ca≈øes limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bounded with expre≈øs in≈øtructions, and accountable to the next Se≈ø≈øion, which will avoid all tho≈øe dangers feared from a Councel of State, as at pre≈øent this is con≈øtituted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are not ≈øatisfied with the clau≈øe, whereas it is ≈øaid, <hi>that

Neither is it cleer what is meant by the≈øe words, <hi>(viz.) That the Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have the highe≈øt final judgement.</hi> They conceiving that their Authority in the≈øe ca≈øes, is onely to make Laws, Rules, and Directions for other Courts and Per≈øon; a≈ø≈øigned by Law for the execution thereof, unto which every member of the Common-wealth, as well tho≈øe of the Repre≈øentative, as others, ≈øhould be alike ≈øubject; it being likewi≈øe unrea≈øonable in it ≈øelf, and an occa≈øion of much partiality, inju≈øtice, and vexation to the people, that the Law-makers, ≈øhould be Law-executors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Although it doth provide that in the Laws hereafter to be made, no per≈øon by vertue of any Tenure, Grant, Charter, Parent, Degree, or Birth, ≈øhall be priviledged from ≈øubjection thereunto, or from being bound thereby, as well as others; Yet doth it not null and make void tho≈øe pre≈øent Protections by Law, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe; nor leave all per≈øons, as well Lords as others, alike liable in per≈øon and e≈øtate, as in rea≈øon and con≈øcience they ought to be.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are very much un≈øatisfied with what is expre≈øt as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve from the Repre≈øentative, in matters of Religion, as being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ob≈øcure, and full of perplexity, that ought to be mo≈øt plain and clear; there having occurred no greater trouble to the Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing than by the intermedling of Parliaments in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They ≈øeem to conceive it ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary, that there be in their Agreement, a re≈øerve from ever having any Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and a bar again≈øt re≈øtoring the Hou≈øe of Lords, both which are wanting in the Agreement which is before you.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They ≈øeem to be re≈øolved to take away all known and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den≈øome grievances, as Tythes, that great oppre≈ø≈øion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries indu≈øtry and hindrance of Tillage: Exci≈øe, and Cu≈øtoms, Tho≈øe ≈øecret thieves, and Robbers, Drainers of the poor and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ≈øort of People, and the greate≈øt Ob≈øtructers of Trade, ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting all the prejudices of Ship-mony, Pattents, and Projects, before this Parliament: al≈øo to take away all Monopolizing Companies of Marchants, the hinderers and decayers of Clothing
<pb facs="tcp:116135:3"/>
and Cloth-working, Dying, and the like u≈øeful profe≈ø≈øions; by which thou≈øands of poor people might be ≈øet at work, that are now ready to ≈øtarve, were Marchandizing re≈øtored to its due and proper freedom: they conceive likewi≈øe that the three grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before mentioned, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Monopolizing Companies, Exci≈øe, and Cu≈øtomes, do exceedingly prejudice Shiping, and Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Con≈øequently di≈øcourage Sea-men, and Marriners, and which have had no ≈ømal influence upon the late unhappy revolts which have ≈øo much endangered the Nation, and ≈øo much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged your enemies. They al≈øo incline to direct a more equal and le≈ø≈øe burden≈øome way for levying monies for the future, tho≈øe other fore-mentioned being ≈øo chargable in the receipt, as that the very ≈øtipends and allowance to the Officers attending thereupon would defray a very great part of the charge of the Army; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now they engender and ≈øupport a corrupt intere≈øt. They al≈øo have in mind to take away all impri≈øonment of di≈øabled men, for debt; and to provide ≈øome effectual cour≈øe to enforce all that are able to a ≈øpeedy payment, and not ≈øuffer them to be ≈øheltered in Pri≈øons, where they live in plenty, whil≈øt their Creditors are undone. They have al≈øo in mind to provide work, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maintainance for all ≈øorts of poor, aged, and impotent people, and to e≈øtabli≈øh ≈øome more ≈øpeedy, le≈ø≈øe trouble≈øome and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way for deciding of Controver≈øies in Law, whole families having been ruined by ≈øeeking right in the wayes yet in being: All which (though of greate≈øt and mo≈øt immediate concernment to the People, are yet omitted in their Agreement before you.</p>
            <p>The≈øe and the like are their intentions in what they purpo≈øe for an Agreement of the People, as being re≈øolved (≈øo far as they are able) to lay an impo≈ø≈øibility upon all whom they ≈øhall hereafter tru≈øt, of ever wronging the Common wealth in any con≈øiderable mea≈øure, without certainty of ruining them≈øelves, and as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to be an improper tedious, and unprofitable thing for the People, to be ever runing after their Repre≈øentatives with Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for redre≈ø≈øe of ≈øuch Grievances as may at once be removed by them≈øelves, or to depend for the≈øe things ≈øo e≈ø≈øential to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈ø≈øe and freedom, upon the uncertain judgements of ≈øeveral Repre≈øentatives, the one being apt to renew what the other hath taken away.</p>
            <p>And as to the u≈øe of their Rights and Liberties herein as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb facs="tcp:116135:3"/>
and is due to the people, from whom all ju≈øt powers are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; they hoped for and expect what protection is in you and the Army to afford: and we likewi≈øe in their and our own behalfe do earne≈øtly de≈øire, that you will publikely declare your re≈øolution to protect tho≈øe who have not forfeited their liberties in the u≈øe thereof, le≈øt they ≈øhould conceive that the Agreement before you being publi≈øhed abroad, and the Commi≈ø≈øioners therein nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted being at work in per≈øuance thereof, is intended to be impo≈øed upon them, which as it is ab≈øolutely contrary to the nature of a free Agreement, ≈øo we are per≈øwaded it cannot enter into your thoughts to u≈øe any impul≈øion therein.</p>
            <p>But although we have pre≈øented our apprehen≈øions and de≈øires concerning this great work of an Agreement, and are apt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade our ≈øelves that nothing ≈øhall be able to fru≈øtrate our hopes which we have built thereupon; yet have we ≈øeen and heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of late, which occa≈øions not only apprehen≈øions of other matters intended to be brought upon us of danger to ≈øuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, but of bondage and ruine to all ≈øuch as ≈øhall pur≈øue it.</p>
            <p>In≈øomuch that we are even aga≈øt and a≈øtoni≈øhed to ≈øee that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding the productions of the highe≈øt notions of freedom that ever this Nation, or any people in the world, have brought to light, notwith≈øtanding the va≈øt expece of blood and trea≈øure that hath been made to purcha≈øe tho≈øe freedoms, notwith≈øtanding the many eminent and even miraculous Victories God hath been plea≈øed to honour our ju≈øt Cau≈øe withall, notwith≈øtanding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gripes and pangs, this Hou≈øe hath ≈øuffered more than once at the hands of your own ≈øervants, and that at lea≈øt ≈øeemingly for the obtaining the≈øe our Native Liberties.</p>
            <p>When we con≈øider what rackings and tortures the People in general have ≈øuffered through decay of Trade, and deerne≈ø≈øe of food, and very many families in particular, through Free-quarter, Violence, and other mi≈øeries, incident to warre, having nothing to ≈øupport them therein, but hopes of Freedom, and a well-≈øetled Common-wealth in the end.</p>
            <p>That yet after all the≈øe things have bin done and ≈øuffered, and whil≈øt the way of an Agreement of the People is owned, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, even by your ≈øelves, and that all men are in expectation of being put into po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of ≈øo deer a purcha≈øe; Behold! in the clo≈øe of all, we hear and ≈øee what gives us fre≈øh and pregnant cau≈øe

to believe that the contrary is really intended, and that all tho≈øe ≈øpecious preten≈øes, and high Notions of Liberty, with tho≈øe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary cour≈øes that have of late bin taken (as if of nece≈ø≈øity for liberty, and which indeed can never be ju≈øtified, but de≈øerve the greate≈øt puni≈øhments, unle≈øs they end in ju≈øt liberty, and an equal Government) appear to us to have bin done and directed by ≈øome ≈øecret powerful influences, the more ≈øecurely and un≈øu≈øpectedly to attain to an ab≈øolute domination over the Common-wealth: it being impo≈ø≈øible for them, but by a≈ø≈øuming our generally appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Principles, and hiding under the fair ≈øhew thereof their other de≈øigns, to have drawn in ≈øo many good and godly men (really aiming at what the other had but in ≈øhew and preten≈øe) and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them unwittingly in≈øtrumental to their own and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Bondage.</p>
            <p>For where is that good, or where is that liberty ≈øo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ≈øo deerly purcha≈øed? If we look upon what this Hou≈øe hath done ≈øince it hath voted it ≈øelf the Supreme Authority, and disburthened them≈øelves of the power of the Lords. Fir≈øt, we find a high Court of Ju≈øtice erected, for Tryal of Criminal cau≈øes; whereby that great and ≈øtrong hold of our pre≈øervation, the way of tryal by 12. ≈øworn men of the Neighborhood is infringed, all liberty of exception again≈øt the tryers, is over-ruled by a Court con≈øi≈øting of per≈øons pickt and cho≈øen in an un-u≈øual way; the practi≈øe whereof we cannot allow of, though again≈øt open and notorious enemies; as well becau≈øe we know it to be an u≈øual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to introduce by ≈øuch means all u≈øurpations, fir≈øt again≈øt Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaries, in hope of ea≈øier admi≈ø≈øion; as al≈øo, for that the ≈øame being ≈øo admited, may at plea≈øure be exerci≈øed again≈øt any per≈øon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons what≈øoever. This is the fir≈øt part of our new liberty. The next is the cen≈øuring of a Member of this Hou≈øe, for declaring his judgement in a point of Religion, which is directly oppo≈øite to the Re≈øerve in the Agreement concerning Religion. Be≈øides the Act for pre≈ø≈øing of Sea-men, directly contrary to the Agreement of the Officers.

               <salute>M. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am very glad that without any inconvenience unto my ≈øelf, and tho≈øe that are with me, I may freely and cheerfully addre≈øs my ≈øelf to this honorable Hou≈øe, as the Supreme Authority of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (time was when I could not) and it much refre≈øheth my ≈øpirit, to live to ≈øee this day, that yon have made ≈øuch a ≈øtep to the Peoples Liberties, as to own and declare your ≈øelves to be (as indeed you are) the Supreme Authority of this Nation.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I am de≈øired by a company of hone≈øt men, living in and about London, who in truth do rightly appropriate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, the title of the Contrivers, Promoters, Pre≈øenters, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers of the late Large London Petition of the <hi>11.</hi> of <hi>Sept.</hi> la≈øt, (which was the fir≈øt Petition I know of in England, that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented to this honorable Hou≈øe again≈øt the late de≈øtructive Per≈øonal Treaty with the late King) to pre≈øent you with their ≈øerious appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øions; And give me leave (I be≈øeech you) for my ≈øelf and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>hem, to ≈øay thus much; That for the mo≈øt part of us, we are tho≈øe that in the wor≈øt of times dur≈øt own our Liberties and Freedoms, in the face of the greate≈øt of our adver≈øaries; and from the begiting of the≈øe Wars, never ≈øhrunk from the owning of our Freedoms, in the mo≈øt tempe≈øtuous times, nor changed our Principles: Nay <hi>Sir,</hi> let me with truth tell you, that to the mo≈øt of us, our Wives, our Children, our E≈øtates, our Relations, nay our Lives, and all that upon earth we can call Ours, have not bin ≈øo highly valued by us, as our Liberties and Freedoms; which our constant Actions (to the apparent hazard of our Bloud and Lives) have bin a cleer and full demon≈øtration of, for the≈øe many yeers together.</p>
            <p>And M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> give me leave to tell you, that I am confident our Liberties and Freedoms (the true and ju≈øt end of all the late
<pb facs="tcp:116135:9"/>
Wars) are ≈øo deer and precious to us, that we had rather our Lives ≈øhould breath out with them, than to live one moment after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of them.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I mu≈øt confe≈øs I am to pre≈øent you with a paper, ≈øomthing of a new kind, for we have had no longer time to con≈øider of it, than from Thur≈øday la≈øt, and Warrants (as we are informed) i≈ø≈øuing out again≈øt us to take us, from tho≈øe that have no power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us; we dur≈øt not well go our ordinary way to work, to get Sub≈øcriptions to it, le≈øt we ≈øhould be ≈øurpri≈øed before we could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent it to this honorable Hou≈øe, and ≈øo be fru≈øtrated in that benefit or relief that we ju≈øtly expect from you; and to pre≈øent it with a few hands, we judged incon≈øiderable in your e≈øtimation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chu≈øe in the third place (being in ≈øo much ha≈øt as we were to prevent our eminent and too apparent ruine) in per≈øon to bring it to your Bar, and avowedly to pre≈øent it here: And therefore without any further que≈øtion, give me leave to tell you, I own it, and I know ≈øo doth all the re≈øt of my Friends pre≈øent; and if any hazard ≈øhould en≈øue thereby, Give me leave re≈øolvedly to tell you, I am ≈øorry I have but one life to lo≈øe, in maintaining the Truth, Ju≈øtice, and Righteou≈øne≈øs, of ≈øo gallant a piece.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> We own this honorable Hou≈øe (as of right) the true Guardian of our Liberties and Freedoms; and we wi≈øh and mo≈øt heartily de≈øire, you would rou≈øe up your ≈øpirits (like men of gallantry) and now at la≈øt take unto your ≈øelves a magnanimous re≈øolution, to acquit your ≈øelves (without fear or dread) like the cho≈øen and betru≈øted Tru≈øtees of the People, from whom (as your ≈øelves acknowledge and declare) all ju≈øt power is derived, to free us from all bondage and ≈ølavery, and really and truly inve≈øt us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the price of all our bloud, hazards, and toyls; Our Liberties and Freedoms, the true difference and di≈øtinction of men from bea≈øts.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Though my spirit is full in the ≈øad apprehen≈øion of the dying condition of our Liberties and Freedoms: Yet at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent I ≈øhall ≈øay no more, but in the behalf of my ≈øelf and my friends, I ≈øhall earne≈øtly entreat you to read the≈øe our ≈øerious Apprehen≈øions ≈øeriou≈øly, and debate them deliberately.</p>

            <p>This we have adventured to publi≈øh for the timely information and benefit of all that adhere unto the common intere≈øt of the people, hoping that with ≈øuch, upon due con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, it will find as large an acceptance, as our late Petition of <hi>Sept.</hi> 11. 1648. And we thought good (in regard we were not called in to receive an an≈øwer to the ≈øame) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that we intend to ≈øecond it with a Petition ≈øufficiently ≈øub≈øcribed, we doubt not with many thou≈øands, earne≈øtly to ≈øolicite for an effectual An≈øwer.</p>
